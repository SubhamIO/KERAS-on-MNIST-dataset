# About MNIST Dataset:
- The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems and predict the handwritten digit among digits 0 to 9.
- MNIST is a simple computer vision dataset. It consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits.
- Every MNIST data point, every image, can be thought of as an array of numbers describing how dark each pixel is.
- Since each image has 28 by 28 pixels, we get a 28x28 array. We can flatten each array into a 28âˆ—28=784 dimensional vector. Each component of the vector is a value between zero and one describing the intensity of the pixel. Thus, we generally think of MNIST as being a collection of 784-dimensional vectors.

<p>
  - In this , we will apply different Weight-Initialisation techniques,Batch Normalisations, DropOuts(for Regularisation to reduce Overfitting) and Optimisers , on MNIST Dataset to observe how it works out . Then , we will calculate the Accuracies to see which model works better !!
